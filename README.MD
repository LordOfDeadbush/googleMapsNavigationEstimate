# Google Maps Navigation Estimate

These functions allow you to get a travel ETA from coordinates by using google maps.

recently when I was doing a hackathon, I could not use the google distance matrix API because it is too expensive (who wants to pay 200 bucks a month!!!)

This is the solution (at least for js)

Happy Hacking!
